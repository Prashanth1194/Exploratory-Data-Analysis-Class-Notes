```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Read in data:

```{r}
Warriors = read.csv("gsw2017-18.csv")
```

What are the average weights by position?

```{r}
aggregate(Wt ~ Pos, mean, data = Warriors)
```

Put factor in order:

```{r}
Warriors$Pos = factor(Warriors$Pos, levels = c("PG", "SG", "SF", "PF", "C"))
summary(Warriors$Pos)
```

Sort name as a factor by first position and then weight;

```{r}
o = order(Warriors$Pos, Warriors$Wt)
Warriors$Player = factor(Warriors$Player, levels = Warriors$Player[o])
summary(Warriors$Player)
```

Split player names:

```{r}
library(stringr)
str_split(Warriors$Player, "\\\\")
```
